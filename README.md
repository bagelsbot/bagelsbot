# Hi I'm Bagels âœ¨

# Education
CS-Math student, currently learning Java through university, and C++ in my little free time.

## Interests and Hobbies
I like math, anime, tea, and dark academia aesthetic. My favourite language so far has been C++ ;)

## Future Plans
I'd like to pursue a masters in either CS or math, and eventually have a career as a software or game developer.
